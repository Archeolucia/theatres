<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The GIS here proposed is the result of the project “circuses, theaters, amphitheaters: where, when and why” aimed to collect
  data about entertainment buildings all over the roman empire. First step of the work was study of the published works,
 especially the ones by
<a href="https://books.google.it/books/about/Roman_Circuses.html?id=couetXBQO9AC&redir_esc=y" target="_blank">J. H. Humphrey (1986)</a> and R. G. Chase (2002), and the historical sources.</p>
<p> Afterwards the building have been mapped thanks to the identification through satellite images. Four different categories
  of buildings have been detected: circuses, theaters, amphitheaters and stadiums.</p>
<p>For each category different informations are available: name, city, nation, if the building is exactly located and if it
  is still visible today. The circuses are the main focus of this research and, for this typology, the following information
  is available: year of construction, century of construction, size (meters), if the circus is linked to an imperial palace
  and the minimum distance from the city walls (meters).</p>
